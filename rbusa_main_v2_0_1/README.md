# rbusa_main
Curation of cultural data relevant to science (or biology).

Named after Roberto Busa, one of the first people to recognize that computers could  be used as a tool for analysing culture by performing tedious work on large dataset, which no philosopher or scientist would want to do. Intended to accompany the "geisen" (Gustav Eisen) repository, which is used for curating biological information.
